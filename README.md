'rxylib Shiny' is a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) app providing a graphical user interface for the **R** package ['rxylib'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rxylib). The app allows visualising x-y data from different file formats. For a complete overview see the ['rxylib'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rxylib) manual.

It is possible to load different file formats and see the x-y plot. You can zoom in, investigate details in your data and fit the data.
Another feature is the transformation of data, e.g. translating wavelength spectra into energy sepctra or normalisations, ...

## Some Highlights:

* Interactive plots
* Copy-paste your data into the application
* Build-in transformations
* Fit data to different functions
* Download converted data as *.csv file 
* Download fitted values and figures as pdf, eps, jpeg, ...
